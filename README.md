# Text_to_Speech_bali
This project implements a Text-to-Speech web application using Python's Flask framework for the backend and a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend. Users can enter text into a web interface, and the Flask backend leverages a text-to-speech library (like pyttsx3) to convert the text into audio.
